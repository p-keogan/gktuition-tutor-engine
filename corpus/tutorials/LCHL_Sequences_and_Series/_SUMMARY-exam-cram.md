## 🧭 Why Sequences and Series deserves the first 90 minutes

From the 11-year exam-trends analysis (2015–2025, 30 papers, 1,212 tagged question-parts):

- **Sequences and Series appears in 11/11 years on Paper 1.** Average ≈ 6.0 parts per paper. Total: **66 P1 parts**.
- **2025 surge:** 2025 had **12** S&S parts — double the historical average and the highest single-year count since 2018 (which had 11). The 2019–2024 average was 5.2; 2025 broke that pattern hard. Plan as if 2026 could swing high too.
- **Geometric content dominates arithmetic.** `sequences-series-5` (geometric `Tₙ` and `Sₙ`) has 21 P1 citations; the arithmetic opener has 11. If you only revise one half of the strand, revise geometric.
- **Section split:** "Usually in Q4 or Q5 of Section A (sequence-pattern fluency) and Q7 of Section B (financial-maths context)" — exam trends file. The Section B Q7 financial-maths spine is reliably worth ~50 marks when it appears.
- **Cross-strand reach:** S&S also fires inside Financial Maths (the annuity / amortisation formulas *are* geometric series), Indices & Logs (whenever `n` is in the exponent — IL-5 fires), Algebra (`Sₙ > bound` collapses to a quadratic inequality — 2025 P1), F&G/Limits (S&S-14 is the canonical cross-listing to F&G-10), Induction (S&S-10 is the prescribed proof), and Paper 1 Proofs (S&S-15 — S∞ derivation).

**The takeaway.** S&S has the highest year-to-year variance of any Tier-1 strand: 3 parts in 2023, 12 in 2025. The downside is unpredictable weight; the upside is that the load-bearing rules are short, the page-22 formulas do most of the work, and the question patterns repeat.

| Rank | Tutorial | P1 citations | What it tests |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `sequences-series-5` Geometric Sequences 1 | **21** | `Tₙ = a·r^(n−1)`, `Sₙ = a(1−rⁿ)/(1−r)`; identifying `a` and `r` |
| 2 | `sequences-series-8` Geometric Sequences 4 | **16** | `S∞ = a/(1−r)`, the `\|r\| < 1` convergence check |

## 📖 Log tables — the pages you'll actually flip to

| Page | Formula | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **p. 22** | `Tₙ = a + (n−1)d` | Arithmetic — nth term. `a` = first term, `d` = common difference |
| **p. 22** | `Sₙ = (n/2)[2a + (n−1)d]` | Arithmetic — sum to n terms |
| **p. 22** | `Tₙ = a·r^(n−1)` | Geometric — nth term. `a` = first term, `r` = `T₂/T₁` |
| **p. 22** | `Sₙ = a(1−rⁿ)/(1−r)` (or `a(rⁿ−1)/(r−1)`) | Geometric — sum to n terms. Use the `1−r` form when `r < 1`, the `r−1` form when `r > 1` |
| **p. 22** | `S∞ = a/(1−r)`, valid when `\|r\| < 1` | Sum to infinity. The convergence condition is **printed beside the formula** |
| p. 21 | `log(aⁿ) = n·log(a)` | Whenever `n` is in the exponent — IL-5 |

> **🎯 Page 22 is your entire strand.** Both arithmetic and geometric formulas, plus `S∞`, live on one page. Flip to it once at the start of the question and don't shut it.

## 📚 Learning work — what must be in your head before you sit down

These are the items page 22 **doesn't** give you. Drill until they're automatic.

### 1. The `|r| < 1` convergence condition for `S∞`

Printed next to the formula, but easy to miss in exam pressure. **Apply `S∞` only when `|r| < 1`.** If `|r| ≥ 1` the series diverges and the formula gives nonsense.

> Paul (sequences-series-8 [04:38]): *"Beside the sum to infinity formula, it tells you that you can only use this formula if the absolute value of r is less than 1. Mathematically another way of saying that is saying that r needs to be between 1 and minus 1."*

This is also the rejection criterion when "find `r`" produces two candidates — drop the one with `|r| ≥ 1`. Paul (S&S-8 [20:18]): *"only one of these answers is valid… It's because there's a sum to infinity. If a sum to infinity exists that means that the absolute value of r has to be less than 1."*

### 2. The differences-method for quadratic and cubic patterns

Not on the tables. You must have them cold:

```
Quadratic pattern  Tₙ = an² + bn + c   ⇔   2nd difference is constant, equal to  2a
Cubic pattern      Tₙ = an³ + bn² + cn + d   ⇔   3rd difference is constant, equal to  6a
```

Once you have `a` from the constant difference, sub `n = 1, 2` (and `n = 3` for cubic) into the form to get simultaneous equations in the remaining coefficients.

> Paul (Patterns 1 [00:12]): *"In order to identify something as a quadratic pattern you need to prove that the second difference is common."* Also [01:21]: *"In the Leaving Cert if you've got a question like this you should mention the phrase 'second difference'."* — state the test by name.

### 3. The `Tₙ = Sₙ − Sₙ₋₁` identity

When the question gives you `Sₙ` (not `Tₙ`) and asks for individual terms, you can always recover `Tₙ = Sₙ − Sₙ₋₁`. Companion identity for the slice-sum trick: `S_m − S_k` = sum from term `k+1` to `m` (sequences-series-3).

### 4. The `(a−d, a, a+d)` and `(a/r, a, ar)` tricks

When "three consecutive terms of an AP/GP" is set up symmetrically as `(a−d, a, a+d)` (AP) or `(a/r, a, ar)` (GP), the middle-term parameter `a` drops out of any sum or product condition, halving the algebra (sequences-series-4 closing block).

### 5. Year-0 vs year-1 indexing in financial sequences

The `Tₙ = a·r^(n−1)` formula assumes term 1 = `a`. For year-0-indexed sequences ("price in Year 0 = `a`"), use `Tₖ = a·rᵏ` — raise to the power that **counts the years**. Tested 2017, 2020, 2022 DF, 2024.

## 🚨 LOAD-BEARING — the five things that win or lose the S&S question

### 1. The page-22 formulas, applied with the right `a`, `r`, `d`, `n`

> The formulas are given. **The marks are for setting up `a`, `r`, and `n` correctly.**

Most lost marks here aren't formula failures — they're parameter-identification failures. For arithmetic: `a` = first term, `d` = (any term) − (previous term). For geometric: `a` = first term, `r = T₂/T₁` (must equal `T₃/T₂` — if not, it isn't geometric).

> 🚨 **Tested every year. 11/11 since 2015.**

### 2. `|r| < 1` is mandatory before applying `S∞`

The single most-deducted error on `S∞` questions. **State the convergence check explicitly** — even if it's "obviously" satisfied.

| Condition | What to do |
|---|---|
| `\|r\| < 1` | `S∞ = a/(1−r)` applies — finite |
| `\|r\| ≥ 1` | Diverges. `S∞` does NOT exist. Reject this `r` candidate if the question asks for `S∞` |
| Two candidate `r`s, one with `\|r\| < 1` and one with `\|r\| ≥ 1` | Reject the divergent one. (2018 Q4 was exactly this — pick `x = 8` over `x = 1`) |

> 🚨 Tested 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, 2024 DF — every other year, on average.

### 3. "Smallest `n` for which `Tₙ < bound`" — take logs, watch the sign-flip

The geometric-decay pattern. For `0 < r < 1`:

1. Write `a·r^(n−1) < bound`.
2. **Take logs of both sides** (IL-5 — load-bearing toolkit cross-strand).
3. **Divide by `log(r)`**, which is **negative** since `r < 1` — **inequality flips**.
4. Round **up** to the next integer (smallest `n` strictly greater than the algebraic answer).

> 🚨 Paul (sequences-series-8 [09:30]): *"ignore the inequality and ... actually work out what is the value for n for which Tₙ is equal to 0.01. When I get that value at the end I can then deduce whether I need to round up or round down."* Tested 2017, 2021, 2024 DF, 2025 DF.

### 4. `Sₙ > bound` for an arithmetic series ⇒ quadratic inequality

For arithmetic, `Sₙ = (n/2)[2a + (n−1)d]` is **quadratic in `n`**. When asked "for what `n` does `Sₙ > K`?", set up `Sₙ = K`, expand to `An² + Bn − K = 0`, solve via the quadratic formula (page 20), take the positive root, round up.

> 🚨 2025 P1 was this exact pattern. Tested heavily in the 2020/2025 algebra–S&S crossover. Algebra-9 (quadratic formula) is the load-bearing partner.

### 5. Limits as `n → ∞` — divide every term by the highest power of `n`

Calculation Type 2 from F&G-10 / S&S-14. For `lim_{n→∞} (3n² + 5)/(2n² − n + 1)`:

```
divide top and bottom by n²:   (3 + 5/n²) / (2 − 1/n + 1/n²)  →  3/2  as  n → ∞
```

Each `(constant)/n^k` term tends to 0. Companion fact: `rⁿ → 0` whenever `|r| < 1` (which is also the `S∞` convergence condition — same idea).

> 🚨 Tested 2020, 2022, 2023, 2023 DF, 2024. Limits is the silent half of "sequences and series and limits" — easy marks if you've seen the recipe.

## 🎯 The 7 techniques you must execute without thinking

1. **Identify `a` and `r` (or `a` and `d`)** from the first two or three terms. For geometric, always verify `T₂/T₁ = T₃/T₂` — if it doesn't, the sequence isn't geometric.
2. **Prove a sequence is arithmetic / geometric** by Method 1 (show the constant-difference / constant-ratio relation directly) or Method 2 (derive `Tₙ`, then compute `Tₙ₊₁ − Tₙ` or `Tₙ₊₁/Tₙ` and show it doesn't depend on `n`).
3. **"Find `a` and `r`" simultaneous equations.** Given two equations like `Tₚ = X` and `Tq = Y`, divide them — `a` cancels — solve for `r`, then back-substitute (sequences-series-7).
4. **Slice-sum trick.** `S_m − S_k` = sum of terms from `T_{k+1}` to `T_m`. Useful when the question asks for a partial range, e.g. "sum of terms 10 to 20".
5. **Patterns method (quadratic / cubic).** Build a difference table. Constant 2nd diff ⇒ quadratic; constant 3rd diff ⇒ cubic. Use `2a = constant 2nd diff` (or `6a = constant 3rd diff`), then 2 (or 3) simultaneous equations from `T₁, T₂` (and `T₃`) to get the remaining coefficients.
6. **Recurring decimal → fraction via `S∞`.** Write the recurring block as a geometric series with first term = block/10^(block length) and ratio = 1/10^(block length); apply `S∞` (sequences-series-9).
7. **Induction proof of `Sₙ`.** The 4-step framework — `P(1)`, assume `P(k)`, prove `P(k+1)`, conclude — applied to the arithmetic or geometric sum formula (sequences-series-10). Requires the full Induction §1–6 chapter as prerequisite.

## ⚠ Common traps — where students lose marks

| Trap | Fix |
|---|---|
| Applying `S∞` without checking `\|r\| < 1` | State the check explicitly. If `\|r\| ≥ 1`, the series diverges — answer "does not exist" |
| Picking the wrong `r` when two candidates exist (e.g. `r = 1/2` vs `r = 2`) | If the question mentions `S∞`, pick `\|r\| < 1`. That's the rejection criterion |
| Forgetting to flip the inequality when dividing by `log(r)` with `r < 1` | `log(0.9) < 0` — dividing by a negative flips the inequality |
| `Tₙ` vs `Sₙ`: using `Tₙ = a + (n−1)d` when the question asks for the sum | Read carefully. "The 10th term" → `Tₙ`. "The sum of the first 10 terms" → `Sₙ` |
| Year-indexing off-by-one (5 years compounding ≠ `T₅`) | Write out Year 0, Year 1, Year 2… in a table before applying `Tₙ` |
| Patterns: mistaking the constant 2nd difference for `a` itself | The constant 2nd difference equals **2a**, not `a`. Halve it |
| Solving `Sₙ > K` and rounding down | The smallest `n` for which `Sₙ > K` is the ceiling of the algebraic answer — round **up** |
| `Sₙ` formula direction: using `(rⁿ − 1)/(r − 1)` when `r < 1` | Both forms are equivalent. The `(1 − rⁿ)/(1 − r)` form keeps numerator positive when `r < 1` |
| Mixing AP and GP formulas (they sit next to each other on p. 22) | Read the formula line carefully — different `T` and `S` for each |
| For `S∞` on alternating series, treating `r = −1/3` as divergent | `\|r\|` = `1/3` < 1, so it converges. The sign of `r` doesn't affect convergence, only the magnitude |

## 📋 Question-type triage — reading the question wording

| Phrase | Strategy |
|---|---|
| *"Show that the sequence is arithmetic / geometric"* | Method 1 — show `T₂ − T₁ = T₃ − T₂` (or ratio version). Name the method |
| *"Find the value of `n` for which `Tₙ = K`"* | Set `a + (n−1)d = K` (AP) or `a·r^(n−1) = K` (GP); for GP take logs |
| *"Find the smallest `n` for which `Tₙ < bound`"* (decaying GP) | Take logs, flip inequality (since `log(r) < 0`), round up |
| *"Find the sum to infinity"* | Verify `\|r\| < 1`, then apply `S∞ = a/(1−r)` |
| *"For what value of `x` does the series have a sum to infinity?"* | Solve `\|r(x)\| < 1` — usually a linear or quadratic inequality on `x` |
| *"Find `n` such that `Sₙ > bound`"* (AP) | Set up `(n/2)[2a + (n−1)d] = bound`, solve quadratic, round up |
| *"Express the recurring decimal as a fraction"* | Decompose as a geometric series, apply `S∞` |
| *"Prove by induction that …"* | 4-step framework — base case `P(1)`, induction hypothesis `P(k)`, step `P(k+1)`, conclusion |
| *"Find the limit as `n → ∞`"* | Divide top and bottom by highest power of `n`, send each `c/n^k → 0` |
| *"Verify that the second difference is constant"* | Build a difference table; state "second difference = …" explicitly |

## 💡 Three exam-day tips that move the needle

1. **State the convergence check before applying `S∞`.** Two lines: "`|r| = … < 1`, so `S∞` exists" then the formula. The check is worth a method mark every time and prevents you from applying the formula to a divergent series.

2. **Build a table for indexed problems.** Whenever the question mentions Year 0 / Year 1 / month 1 / repayment 1, write the first three rows of the table before reaching for `Tₙ`. The off-by-one error vanishes once the table is in front of you.

3. **For Section B Q7 financial-maths, set up `a`, `r`, and `n` first — then read the question again.** Q7 is dense with context; the maths only starts after you've identified the geometric structure underneath the words. The annuity / amortisation formulas are geometric-series sums in disguise.

---

## 🔗 Cross-strand connections (where else S&S fires)

- **S&S ↔ Financial Maths** — the annuity formula and the amortisation formula (Paper 1 Proofs §4) are direct geometric-series applications. Q7 of Section B in financial-maths years (2017, 2020, 2023, 2024, 2024 DF, 2025 DF) is essentially an S&S question with a money skin.
- **S&S ↔ Indices and Logs** — `Tₙ = a·r^(n−1) < bound` always demands IL-5 (take logs to bring `n` down). Sign-flip rule from IL-5/algebra-6 fires when `log(r) < 0`.
- **S&S ↔ Algebra** — `Sₙ > bound` for an AP is a quadratic inequality in `n` (2025 P1; 2020 P1). Algebra-9's quadratic formula is the partner.
- **S&S ↔ Functions and Graphs (§10 Limits)** — sequences-series-14 is the cross-listing. F&G-10 is the canonical home of limits at infinity (Calculation Type 2: divide by highest power of `n`).
- **S&S ↔ Induction** — sequences-series-10 is the prescribed induction proof of the geometric `Sₙ` formula. Requires the full Induction chapter as prerequisite.
- **S&S ↔ Paper 1 Proofs** — sequences-series-15 is the direct-limit proof of `S∞` (Paper 1 Proofs §5). One of the **five prescribed Paper 1 proofs** that can be asked verbatim. Sum-of-geometric-series proof appeared in 2015.
- **S&S ↔ Complex Numbers** — sum of the `n`-th roots of unity = geometric series sum (2015 P1).
- **S&S ↔ Number Theory** — recurring decimals as rationals via `S∞` (sequences-series-9).

> S&S is the strand that lets the financial-maths question be a question at all. Most of the "30+ marks Section B" payoffs in P1 are S&S in disguise.
